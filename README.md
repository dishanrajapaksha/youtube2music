### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your Desktop or wherever you want.
2. Launch Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right.
4. Click on **Load unpackedâ€¦** on the left and select the cloned repository (folder) from step 1. 

You should now see the extension in the list.

### Usage

Navigate to YouTube, right click any music video, and click on **Open in YouTube Music** in the context menu.

Additionally, you can open all `youtube.com` or `youtu.be` links from 
any other website. The extension enables the link in the context menu 
(right click menu) only if the URL you clicked on has `youtube.com` or 
`youtu.be` in it. Otherwise, the extension stays hidden.

Any video which is not categorized as "Music" is not available in 
YouTube Music, and will show a "This video is not available" error.
